The repo is intended for people who are trying their hand in FPGA development. The IDE I used was **Xilinx Vivado 2019.1** and the development board used was **Digilent Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA Board**.

The material also consists snippets from some of the lab assignments of the course **Embedded Logic Design**. The course is offered to second-year undergraduate ECE students at IIITD.
